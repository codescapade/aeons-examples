### Info
This is a small 2d platformer example that uses leves that are created with the [LDtk](https://ldtk.io) level editor.  
It also uses the built-in simple physics engine for collisions.  
It has the basic platformer mechanics:
- Jump and wall jump
- Jump on certain enemies to kill them
- One way platforms
- Collect coins

Reach the flag to complete the level. When you run out of lives or complete the three levels you go back to the intro screen.
